# Hi there! I am Gonzalo HernÃ¡n Rodriguez :sunglasses: 

## âœ¨ About me âœ¨

The main feature that I love about this industry is the tons and tons of technologies out there.

I'm always trying to learn and understand, on a certain level, how all the cool things are built in this new era.
In this endless journey, I was able to get my hands on C, C#, C ++. Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SASS, Bootstrap.

There are too many technologies and I have a long way to go to improve, but I think the most powerful skill I can develop is the flexibility to learn and adapt to a different context because technologies will change over the years.
